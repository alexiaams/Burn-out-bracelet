An Arduino-powered smart bracelet that monitors **temperature** and **stress levels**  
to help prevent burnout with vibration alerts, LED breathing exercises, and real-time feedback.

## üåü About the Project
This was **my first experience with Arduino** and was built as part of **Builders 101**,  
a program supported by **Launch Romania** and **How to Web**.

The bracelet combines multiple sensors to remind the user to take breaks, breathe, or move‚Äî  
helping reduce stress and avoid burnout.

Initially I planned to include **heart-rate variability (HRV) monitoring**,  
but I encountered numerous hardware and signal-processing issues.  
As a temporary workaround, I used an **arbitrary threshold value** in the code  
to simulate a high-stress condition for testing and demonstration purposes.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Temperature & Stress Monitoring** ‚Äì DS18B20 and Grove GSR sensors.
- **Break Alerts** ‚Äì Soft pulsing buzzer and vibration when thresholds are exceeded.
- **Breathing Exercise** ‚Äì LED guides a 4-7-8 breathing pattern.
